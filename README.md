# GoogleReplica
A replica of: Google's search page, Google's image search page and Google's Advanced search page  
This is one of the projects I built while studying Harvard's online CS50 Web development course.

## What is this project
I made a copy of 3 of Google's search pages using HTML and CSS. Each of the pages also sends out the corresponding get request to Google's server dependent on the details entered on the page.
